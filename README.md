# Information 
- [What is it ?](notes/what_is_information.md) 
- What is it made of ?
- What can be done with it?
- How can it be used optimally to answer questions?
  
This is a repo tries to gradually find more sophisticated answers to those questions, either through code or rambling style posts.
Feel free to contact me if you're interested

 ## 1. Kants Knowledge Graph

Was a novice investigation transforming philosophical ideas into knowledge graphs.
Thereby two different approaches have been used to identify entities and relationships.
1. Using Rule based Parsing Systems
2. Using an LLM (Ollama) to extract entities and relationships

Eventually, the results have been visualised using pyvis. As the input size increased, this approach of simply 
visualising all entities and their relationships became unfeasible.
Hence, this project is on hold until I've implemented better solutions.

More (theoretical) thoughts can be found in the following notebook: [Ramble 1](kants_knowledge_graph/ramble.md)


## 2. Ishmaels Guide to Fishing
Fishing for understanding in a personally new field of understanding can easily become an orientationless wandering through a dark forest of (pseudo) knowledge. 
One might need a navigation system find the central intellectual building blocks of this new field of interest.
The aim of this project is, to build exactly this navigation system by developing a tool that automatically identifes central ideas in a given field.
